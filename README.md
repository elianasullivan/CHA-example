# Community Health Assessment (CHA)
This code is for a Community Health Assessment which is an overview of demographics and social determinants of health for counties in Oregon. The code can be run for any of Oregon's 36 counties and includes data that spans 2016-2022. This portion of the project involves exploring and visualizing publically available data that lends insight into the health of each county.

# What is included
All code is written in R. This is a sample of the code I wrote for this project, but still displays most of the techniques / styles that I used. 
- The data_cleaning script contains all of the libraries, data import, cleaning, functions, and pre-set variables for the rest of the code. This should be run first before any of the graphing scripts.
- The Perc_line_graphs script produces all of the line graphs (over time) for data with percentage values. This is just one of multiple, as I have seperate scripts for other graph and data types as each required slightly different processing and this was the most intuitive way for me to organize it. The script includes additional information about how to use it.
- The data_files folder has the data imported in this code.
- The sample graphics folder includes a few of the graphs / figures produced for this project.

I am the only person who wrote and is currently running this code.
